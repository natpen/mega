    <p>Welcome to my slice of the world World Wide Web! I'm Natalie Pendragon, but people on the internet usually know me as natpen. I hope you enjoy your stay here. I am a physicist, inventor, and software developer currently based in New York City. I like dogs, cats, cuddly things, bicycles, forests, sailboats, table tennis, and lots of other things too.</p>
    <p> I'm pretty dang passionate about the environment! Did you know that global warming is a thing that's really happening? <a href="http://climate.nasa.gov/evidence/">It is</a>. We should all do our part to try and reduce our carbon footprint!</p>

    <p>One thing I like to do, now that I drink lots coffee, is to compost the used grounds. We don't have composting in my building/neighborhood/city really, but that's okay, because I just keep a compost bag in the freezer and take it to the farmer's market on Saturday mornings when it gets full! You could probably do this too if you don't have composting! Plus it's a good reason to go to the farmer's market, which always has lots of delicious, colorful, healthy food!</p>
